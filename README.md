----
Shows an in world placement preview of the item held in hand

_Hold `sneak` for more orientations_

player commands/settings: _/placement_preview_ **help**
settings include:
* smooth movement
* only preview stairs and slabs
* disable/enable preview

Originally this mod was intended to only preview stairs/slab placement

_1.1.1 CHANGELOG:_

  * added toggle for pulse animation
    - 'placement_preview pulse_animation true|false'

  bugfix:

  * prevent stair variant when looking a corner variant
  * crash from non player placers
  * prevent overriding stair when variant does not exist

_1.1.0 CHANGELOG:_

  * added support for _outer_ stairs placement & preview (place a normal stairs while looking at the side of a stair)
  * preview distance should now match the gamemode's reach distance (VOXELIBRE) 

_1.0.5 CHANGELOG:_

  * by default only slabs and stairs will preview (can be toggled with command)
  * removed mtg dependency
  * bug fixes (setting: _only_stairs_slabs_, was causing a crash)

_1.0.4 CHANGELOG:_

  * new animation after placing node/block (great for when placing "blocks" quickly)
  * fixed crafting table placement (mcl)
  * actually fixed door placement (80% sure)
  * slightly changed slab placing (still need a bit more work)

_1.0.3 CHANGELOG:_

  * fixed doors and workbench placement

_1.0.2 CHANGELOG:_

  * per player settings (using commands)
  * support for placement of inner and outer stairs
  * bug fixes

_1.0.1 CHANGELOG:_

  * double slab preview
  * better node orientation
  * preview on buildable_to
  * added more compatibility 

_note for devs_: if you want a node to preview like stairs, add "stairs" somewhere in the node's name or description (i may create an api for this at some point)
