1.0.3 CHANGELOG:
- fixed doors and workbench placement

1.0.2 CHANGELOG:

- support for placement of inner and outer stairs
- bug fixes

1.0.1 CHANGELOG:
- double slab preview
- better node orientation

_note for devs_: if you want a node to preview like stairs, add "stairs" somewhere in the node's name or description (i may create an api for this at some point)
